# TU857-Portfolio

👋 Hi, I’m Bilha Maria John
Welcome to my academic and technical portfolio for TU857 Computer Science (Year 1).
This repository documents my learning journey, projects, labs, and skills as I progress through my degree.

🎓 About This Repository
This is a structured collection of all my work from Year 1, Semester 1.
It includes programming assignments, notes, labs, technical exercises, and personal projects across multiple modules.

My goal is to build a clear, professional portfolio that shows:

consistent learning

clean documentation

real technical growth

readiness for future internships and opportunities
